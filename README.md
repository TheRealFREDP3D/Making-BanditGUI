BanditGUI is a web-based interface for the popular OverTheWire Bandit wargame. It aims to make learning cybersecurity fundamentals more approachable by providing a browser-based terminal, structured level information, and an AI-powered assistant.

## Why BanditGUI?

The command-line nature of challenges like Bandit can be a hurdle for beginners. BanditGUI lowers this barrier by:

* Providing an integrated terminal in your browser.
* Offering easy access to level goals, commands, and learning resources.
* Assisting with hints and explanations through an AI chat interface.

## Core Features

* **Interactive Web Terminal:** A full-featured xterm.js terminal in your browser to connect to Bandit via SSH.
