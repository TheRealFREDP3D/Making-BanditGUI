- Update index.html to display badges
- Display badges dynamically on the frontend
- Implement streak logic

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Terminal**: xterm.js with addons
- **SSH**: Paramiko
- **Data Storage**: JSON

### Code Structure

- `banditgui/app.py`: Main Flask application
- `banditgui/chat/chat_manager.py`: Handles chat functionality
- `banditgui/ssh/ssh_manager.py`: Manages SSH connections
- `banditgui/terminal/terminal_manager.py`: Manages terminal interactions
- `banditgui/utils/`: Contains utility functions for level information and data fetching
- `banditgui/config/`: Contains configuration settings and logging setup

### Development Process

- Modular development approach
- Regular code reviews
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation updates
- Clean code practices

## Recent Activities

### Code Improvements

- Fixed spacing issues in the `chat_manager.py` file
- Fixed spacing issues in the `test_level_info.py` file
- Updated the `test_level_info.py` script to use the correct import path
- Identified and noted linting issues for future improvement

### Documentation Updates

- Updated checkboxes for Chapters 3 and 4 in README.md
- Fixed references to the `levels_data` directory
- Updated the command to fetch level information
- Updated the import example to use the correct module path
- Fixed markdown formatting issues
- Ensured proper line endings with two spaces at the end of lines

### Testing

- Ran the `test_level_info.py` script to verify level information functionality
- Performed a full test run of the application
- Verified proper separation of concerns between different modules
- Confirmed the application starts without errors

## Next Steps

1. Implement password management features (v0.4)
2. Add progress tracking functionality (v0.5)
3. Implement gamification elements (v0.6)
4. Continue with the roadmap for future development
5. Address linting issues
6. Add more comprehensive tests
