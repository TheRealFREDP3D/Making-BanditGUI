## The Challenge of Learning Cybersecurity

Learning cybersecurity can be intimidating. Between complex terminology, command-line interfaces, and the need for specialized environments, many beginners find themselves overwhelmed before they even start. The OverTheWire Bandit wargame is an excellent resource for beginners, but it still requires SSH access and command-line knowledge that can create barriers to entry.

That's where BanditGUI comes in.

- Execute commands in a real SSH terminal
- Access level-specific information and hints
- Track their progress through the challenges
- Learn Linux commands and security concepts in a structured way

With BanditGUI, we're removing the barriers to entry for cybersecurity education, making it accessible to anyone with a web browser.
