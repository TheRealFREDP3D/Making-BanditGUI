  - Automatically *routes commands* to the SSH server when connected  
  - Provides appropriate *feedback* based on connection state  
  - Prevents attempts to execute remote commands when not connected  
  
- **Added specialized commands like 'level' for Bandit information**  
  - Implemented a **'level'**command that provides information about specific Bandit challenges  
  - Created a system to load and display *level-specific information*  
  - Helps users understand the *objectives and hints* for each Bandit level  
  - Enhances the educational value of the application  
  
- **Improved terminal styling with custom CSS**  
  - Added *custom CSS* for better terminal appearance and readability  
  - Implemented a *dark theme* with appropriate contrast for terminal text   
  - Styled the terminal container for better integration with the overall UI  
  - Added *responsive design* elements to ensure the terminal works well on different screen sizes  
  
- **Connection via 'connect' command instead of button**  
  - Implemented *SSH connection* through a terminal command rather than a UI button  
  - Provides a more authentic *terminal-based workflow*  
  - Integrates the *connection process* into the terminal experience  
  - Allows for future expansion with connection parameters as command arguments

### v0.2 - Splitting managers into separate modules  
  
**5: Adding a Simple AI Chat Assistant**  
    [ ] 5.1: Creating a Hints Database (JSON File)  
    [ ] 5.2: Updating app.py to Handle Chat Queries  
    [ ] 5.3: Creating the /chat Route  
    [ ] 5.4: Updating index.html to Send Chat Queries  
    [ ] 5.5: Displaying Chat Queries and Responses  
    [ ] 5.6: Expanding the Hints Database  
  
#### Issue  

The terminal module and SSH module had files with the same name (`manager.py`), which could cause confusion when importing or referencing these files.  
  
##### Changes Made  
  
1. **Renamed SSH Manager**  
   - Renamed `banditgui/ssh/manager.py` to `banditgui/ssh/ssh_manager.py`  
   - Updated the logger name to `ssh.ssh_manager`  
  
2. **Renamed Terminal Manager**  
   - Renamed `banditgui/terminal/manager.py` to `banditgui/terminal/terminal_manager.py`  
   - Updated the logger name to `terminal.terminal_manager`  
  
3. **Added Chat Manager**  
   - Created a new directory `banditgui/chat/`  
   - Created `banditgui/chat/chat_manager.py` for chatbox-related features  
   - Implemented the `ChatManager` class with methods for:  
     - Adding messages  
     - Retrieving messages  
     - Setting the current level  
     - Clearing messages  
     - Getting hints for levels  
  
4. **Updated Module Imports**  
   - Updated all imports in `app.py` to reference the new file paths  
   - Added imports for the new `ChatManager` class  
   - Initialized a `chat_manager` instance in `app.py`  
  
5. **Added Chat API Endpoints**  
   - Added `/chat/message` endpoint for adding messages  
   - Added `/chat/messages` endpoint for retrieving messages  
   - Added `/chat/hint` endpoint for getting hints for levels  
  
6. **Updated Module `__init__.py` Files**  
   - Updated `banditgui/ssh/__init__.py` to expose the `SSHManager` class  
   - Updated `banditgui/terminal/__init__.py` to expose the `TerminalManager` class  
   - Created `banditgui/chat/__init__.py` to expose the `ChatManager` class  
  
7. **Removed Old Files**  
   - Removed the original `banditgui/ssh/manager.py` file  
   - Removed the original `banditgui/terminal/manager.py` file  
  
##### Benefits  
  
1. **Improved Code Organization**  
   - Each manager file now has a more descriptive name that clearly indicates its purpose  
   - The chat functionality is now properly separated into its own module  
  
2. **Reduced Confusion**  
   - No more duplicate filenames across different modules  
   - Imports are now more explicit and easier to understand  
  
3. **New Functionality**  
   - Added chat functionality for future implementation of chatbox features  
   - Provided a structured way to handle chat messages and hints  
  
#### Next Steps  
  
1. Implement the frontend components for the chat functionality  
2. Connect the chat API endpoints to the frontend  
3. Add more advanced chat features like:  
   - User authentication for chat  
   - Persistent chat history  
   - Rich text formatting  
   - File sharing capabilities
