# Gamified Learning Path Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Gamified Learning Path transforms BanditGUI into an engaging educational journey by implementing a skill tree, achievements, and progression visualization.

## Core Components

### 1. Skill Tree System (3-4 weeks)

#### Phase 1: Data Structure (1 week)
- Create `skill_tree.py` module with classes for skills, prerequisites, and achievements
- Design JSON schema for storing skill tree data
- Implement skill unlocking logic and progression tracking
- Add persistent storage for user progress

#### Phase 2: Backend API (1 week)
- Create REST endpoints for retrieving skill tree data
- Implement progress tracking API endpoints
- Add user skill status synchronization
- Implement skill validation logic for unlocking new skills

#### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (1-2 weeks)
- Design interactive skill tree visualization using D3.js or similar library
- Create UI components for displaying locked/unlocked skills
- Implement visual transitions for skill progression
- Add tooltips showing skill details and requirements

### 2. Achievement System (2-3 weeks)

#### Phase 1: Achievement Framework (1 week)
- Create `achievements.py` module with achievement classes and triggers
- Develop achievement detection system that monitors user actions
- Implement achievement unlocking logic with persistent storage
- Design achievement categories (Command Mastery, Security Concepts, Challenges)

#### Phase 2: Integration (1 week)
- Connect achievement system to terminal actions
- Implement hooks for capturing user activities
- Create notification system for unlocked achievements
- Add achievement statistics and tracking

#### Phase 3: UI Components (1 week)
- Design achievement badges with different visual styles for rarities
- Create achievement showcase page/panel
- Implement achievement notification animations
- Add achievement progress indicators

### 3. Progression Visualization (2 weeks)

#### Phase 1: Data Processing (1 week)
- Create progress tracking system with metrics and milestones
- Implement data aggregation for progress visualization
- Design level-based progression system with explicit goals
- Add experience points (XP) system for activities

#### Phase 2: UI Implementation (1 week)
- Create progress dashboard with visualizations
- Implement heatmap for activity tracking
- Add progress comparison features (self-improvement tracking)
- Design celebratory animations for milestone achievements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Requirements
- User profile storage with progress tracking
- Achievement and skill status persistence
- Level completion and attempt history

### New Backend Modules
- `gamification/` package with:
  - `skill_tree.py`: Core skill tree logic
  - `achievements.py`: Achievement processing system
  - `progress_tracker.py`: User progress monitoring
  - `experience_system.py`: XP allocation and leveling

### Frontend Components
- Interactive skill tree visualization
- Achievement notification system
- Progress dashboard
- Profile page with achievement showcase

### API Endpoints
- `/api/skills/tree`: Get skill tree structure
- `/api/skills/status`: Get user's skill status
- `/api/achievements/list`: List all achievements
- `/api/achievements/user`: Get user's achievements
- `/api/progress/stats`: Get user progress statistics
- `/api/progress/history`: Get historical progress data

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Core System (Week 1-2)
- Implement data structures and basic functionality
- Create minimal UI for testing
- Develop persistence layer

### Phase 2: Terminal Integration (Week 3-4)
- Connect terminal actions to skill tree and achievements
- Implement real-time progress updates
- Add skill requirement validation

### Phase 3: UI Development (Week 5-6)
- Develop complete user interface
- Implement animations and transitions
- Add responsive design elements

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (Week 7-8)
- User testing and feedback collection
- Performance optimization
- Refinement of game mechanics

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Social features (leaderboards, sharing achievements)
- Challenge modes with time limits
- Custom learning paths based on user interests
- Mentor/mentee relationships with shared achievements
- Certification system for completed skill paths
