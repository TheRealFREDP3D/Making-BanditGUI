# BanditGUI Terminal Implementation

This implementation provides a terminal interface for learning about and interacting with the OverTheWire Bandit CTF server.

## Setup

This implementation uses xterm.js for the terminal interface. To set up the project:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Run the install script to set up xterm.js
   bash install_deps.sh
   ```

The terminal is designed to provide information about the Bandit server and how to connect to it, rather than actually connecting to it.

## Running the Application

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

3. Use the terminal interface to learn about the Bandit server and how to connect to it.

4. Try the following commands:
   - `help`: Display available commands and usage information.
   - `info`: Display information about the Bandit server.
   - `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.
   - `echo [text]`: Display the provided text.
   - `ssh`: Show information about SSH connection parameters.

5. After connecting with the `connect` command, you can run actual commands on the SSH server.

## Features

- **Informational Terminal**: Provides information about the Bandit server and how to connect to it.
- **Command Simulation**: Simulates basic commands like `echo`, `help`, and `clear`.
- **SSH Information**: Provides detailed information about SSH connection parameters for the Bandit server.
- **Command History**: Maintains a history of commands that can be navigated using the up and down arrow keys.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages if a command fails.
- **Training Environment**: Designed as a learning tool to help users understand how to connect to the Bandit server.

## Bandit Server Information

- **Host**: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
- **Port**: 2220
- **Initial Username**: bandit0
- **Initial Password**: bandit0

## Implementation Details

- The terminal is implemented using xterm.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend.
- xterm.js provides a full-featured terminal emulator with support for ANSI escape sequences.
- Commands are processed by the `TerminalManager` class in the backend.
- The terminal interface is styled to look like a real terminal with proper cursor handling and command history.
- The application is designed to be a learning tool, not a replacement for a real SSH client.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed information about each Bandit level.
- Implement a hint system for solving Bandit challenges.
- Add a progress tracking feature to keep track of completed levels.
- Enhance the terminal with more realistic features like tab completion.
- Implement a full SSH client using xterm.js and WebSockets for real-time interaction.
- Add support for terminal resizing and fullscreen mode.
- Implement more terminal features like copy/paste and text selection.
